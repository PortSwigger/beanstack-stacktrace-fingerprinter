<p>
    This extension automatically identifies Java frameworks and libraries by analyzing stack traces found in HTTP
    responses. It sends stack traces to the BeanStack API for fingerprinting and reports identified versions along with
    associated CVEs directly in the Burp Suite dashboard.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This extension sends potentially private stack traces to a third-party service (beanstack.io)
    for processing.
